# BTransceiver
Android application that allows remote control Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO).

This application allows setting-up new frequencies, saving frequencies in microcontroller memory, setting-up frequency bands and sending/receiving text messages to/from the microcontroller (VFO management). 

Also, there is implemented a basic library for morse messaging that provide converting text messages to morse code and their real interpretation on the microcontroller.
